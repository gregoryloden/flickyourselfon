Level 1: three rails, two switches
	side left is down, left is down, right is down
	button 1 on bottom platform
	button 2 on right platform
	turning on square switch makes left go up
	press button 1 to make left go down and right go up
	press button 2 to make side left go up and right go down
	press button 1 to make left go up and right go up (all 3 are up)
Level 2: based on solution: 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 2 1, 4 triggers a rail that enables 2->1, otherwise it's one-way 1->2
Level 3: based on level sketch with rails and hills (level3.jpg, puzzle A2)
Level 4: build a hilly scenery and stick rails and switches on it
Level 5: switch solution 1 2 3 4 3 2 1, require a reset if the player jumps off after kicking the first switch, 3 is closer to 1 than 2 is
	start @0, can access 1,2,3,4
	can't just kick 4, need to activate 1,2,3 in that order, why?
	0->4, can't access 1,2, or 3
	4 activates a connection to 2 and 3, when the proper order is done
	maybe 4 is actually the closest switch to 1
	actually @0 can only access 1
Level 6: 4 x 4 pillars, rails between some, height 3 platforms between others, some pillars at height 5 and some at 7, floor at height 1
	switches only affect rails that don't touch the same plane
	end result has two distinct solutions
Level 7:
	general layout based on the colors and terrain of the past 6 levels (or maybe not, the rest of the 4th area is a reverse-L shape)
