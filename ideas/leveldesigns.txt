Level 1: (see otherideas.txt)
Level 2: based on solution: 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 2 1, 4 triggers a rail that enables 2->1, otherwise it's one-way 1->2
Level 3: based on level sketch with rails and hills (level3.jpg, puzzle A2)
Level 4: build a hilly scenery and stick rails and switches on it
Level 5: switch solution 1 2 3 4 3 2 1, require a reset if the player jumps off after kicking the first switch, 3 is closer to 1 than 2 is
	start @0, can access 1,2,3,4
	can't just kick 4, need to activate 1,2,3 in that order, why?
	0->4, can't access 1,2, or 3
	4 activates a connection to 2 and 3, when the proper order is done
	maybe 4 is actually the closest switch to 1
	actually @0 can only access 1
