Level 1: three rails, two switches
	side left is down, left is down, right is down
	button 1 on bottom platform
	button 2 on right platform
	turning on square switch makes left go up
	press button 1 to make left go down and right go up
	press button 2 to make side left go up and right go down
	press button 1 to make left go up and right go up (all 3 are up)
Level 2: based on solution: 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 2 1, 4 triggers a rail that enables 2->1, otherwise it's one-way 1->2
Level 3: based on level sketch with rails and hills (level3.jpg, puzzle A2)
Level 4: build a hilly scenery and stick rails and switches on it
Level 5: switch solution 1 2 3 4 3 2 1, require a reset if the player jumps off after kicking the first switch, 3 is closer to 1 than 2 is
	start @0, can access 1,2,3,4
	can't just kick 4, need to activate 1,2,3 in that order, why?
	0->4, can't access 1,2, or 3
	4 activates a connection to 2 and 3, when the proper order is done
	maybe 4 is actually the closest switch to 1
	actually @0 can only access 1
Level 6: 4 x 4 pillars, rails between some, height 3 platforms between others, some pillars at height 5 and some at 7, floor at height 1
	switches only affect rails that don't touch the same plane
	end result has two distinct solutions
Level 7:
	general layout based on the colors and terrain of the past 6 levels (or maybe not, the rest of the 4th area is a reverse-L shape)
	"ladder" shape of 4 rails needs to be raised, one rail of each color, ride back and forth across each "rung" to get to level 8
	red left, blue mid-left, green top, white mid-top, ladder at bottom-right
	each section has at least one rail/switch of a different color which you get to from the other color section
	part of the puzzle is figuring out the order that you have to do the different sections in (ex part of one color, then the switch/rail for another color, then all of that color and its ladder, etc.)
	certain switches can be reached by more than one rail, but only one rail gets you there at a time
	treat the level like a maze, having to connect paths to get through
	blue area: re-use the first part with the first two red-black rails raised (via lowering the white-black rail 1x and kicking red-black 2x), for part 2 solution
	green area: the green yellow-red switch is used for milestone 1, and then later for milestone 3
	order: green, blue, red + ladder, white, green, blue + ladder, white, red, green + ladder, red, blue, white + ladder
Level 8:
	level 8 starting area/level 7 victory area is at the bottom left platform of level 1 area, has switch
	level 1 area, far left platform, has steps going up north, and rail going [left?]
	fun idea to have the player walk on planes from previous levels, but might be best to only use new planes
	maybe: colors one at a time?
	part of it: first part: multiple puzzles to unlock the long rails to the end
	part of it: one puzzle is "pick the right rail to get to the end" guessing
	part of it: platform maze
	part of it: towers of hanoi solution 1 2 1 3 1 2 1
	part of it: sine section: 2 switches: both reachable, have to do 2 then 1 because doing 1 first prevents access to 2
	part of it: saw section: circle of switches to raise the last rail; 6 platforms, each with a switch that raises the next rail and also the rail 2 behind
	long rails between sections between old levels, short puzzles at those old levels
