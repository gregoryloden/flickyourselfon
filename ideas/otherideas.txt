square wave switches are just toggle

sine waves go up and down on a timer
-once you are on, it stays in position until you cross

Sine wave or saw wave: switch alternates which rail it affects

multiple levels/heights of bars?
multiple levels/heights per bar?

Jump rails that are one-way?

kick while riding a rail to jump
	kick near a corner to jump to another rail
		"rail-swap" boot indicator

end-of-level tile starts dark then gets big and light then shrinks to light
	tile animation/rotation before you get there

music composition ideas:
	- imagine the notes like a swimming fish, does a u-turn after the first section first half, then keeps swimming
	- imagine the radio tower is trying to reconnect to the boot
