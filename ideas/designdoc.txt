----------------------------------------------------------------
puzzle game

top down

have to power things to do ????
	platforms raise, except when missing a signal
	bridges need a signal
	different frequencies disable things
	some things need a certain combination of frequencies
	frequencies are color coded

switches turn on things
	switches are small radio towers that have lost function

no intense timing (but maybe some timing?)
	rail mechanic will require timing
